**100-Days-Of-Python: A Journey of Pythonic Adventures**

Welcome to my repository, where I'll be documenting my progress and sharing my creations throughout the 100-day Python challenge! Here are some exciting projects I've worked on so far:

### Projects

1. **Mandelbrot Fractals**: Explore the beauty of fractal geometry with this interactive Mandelbrot set generator.
2. **Pong**: A simple but addictive game where you can play a game of Pong against an AI opponent.
3. **Connect 4**: Make your moves and challenge yourself or friends in this classic board game-inspired game.
4. **Flash Cards** Create and test using your own flash cards.
5. **Tetris**: Clear lines by rotating and dropping Tetriminos in this implementation of the classic puzzle game.
5. **Todo List**: Stay organized with a simple todo list app that lets you add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

These projects showcase my growth and experimentation with Python throughout this 100-day journey. I'll be regularly updating this README with new project details, and I'm excited to share them with you!

### What's Next?

Stay tuned for more exciting projects, tips, and insights from my 100-days-of-Python adventure!
