**Mandelbrot Fractal Generator**
=============================

**Introduction**

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that has been extensively studied in the field of mathematics and computer science. This project aims to generate and plot a 3D surface representing the Mandelbrot set using Python.

**Features**

* Generates a fractal grid representing the Mandelbrot set
* Plots the fractal grid as a 3D surface using matplotlib
* Supports adjustable parameters for minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, width and height of the grid, and maximum number of iterations
* Includes a main function to generate and plot the fractal

**How it Works**

The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating a complex function `z = z^2 + c` for each point in the complex plane. The iteration process continues until the magnitude of the result exceeds 2, at which point the point is considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set.

**Configuration Options**

The following configuration options are available:

* `min_x`: Minimum x-coordinate (default: -2.5)
* `max_x`: Maximum x-coordinate (default: 1.0)
* `min_y`: Minimum y-coordinate (default: -2.0)
* `max_y`: Maximum y-coordinate (default: 2.0)
* `width`: Number of columns in the grid (default: 800)
* `height`: Number of rows in the grid (default: 800)
* `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations (default: 256)

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `python main.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

**Tips and Variations**

* Adjust the configuration options to change the scale and resolution of the fractal.
* Experiment with different iteration limits and color maps to create unique visualizations.
* Consider using other libraries, such as Mayavi or Plotly, to visualize the fractal.
