Pong Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module. The game allows two players to control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to outmaneuver the other player and score points by getting the ball past their paddle.

Features
Two-player gameplay.
Keyboard controls for moving the paddles up and down.
Automatic score keeping and display.
Ball speed increases slightly each time it hits a paddle.
The game resets the ball and increases the score when the ball passes a player's paddle.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Installation
No additional libraries are required for this game beyond the Python standard library. You can clone this repository or download the game as a standalone Python file.


Controls
Player A uses W to move the paddle up and S to move down.
Player B uses the Up Arrow key to move the paddle up and the Down Arrow key to move down.
How It Works
The game uses the Python turtle module to draw the game screen, paddles, and ball. The turtle module is a popular way to introduce programming to beginners. It provides a simple environment where users can learn basic programming concepts like loops, functions, and conditional statements.

The main game loop updates the position of the ball and checks for collisions with the paddles or boundaries of the game screen. The score is updated when a player fails to return the ball, and the ball's speed increases each time it is hit by a paddle to increase the challenge.

Future Enhancements Idea's
Add a pause feature.
Include sound effects and music.
Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
Create a graphical user interface to start the game and select options.
